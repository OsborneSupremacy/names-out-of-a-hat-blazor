# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The alarms the topic in sns-notifications.tf was created for.
#
# Two rules shape everything below.
#
# The first is that every alarm here has to be worth waking up for. This application has one
# operator and one inbox, and an alarm that fires on something nobody would act on does not just
# waste a notification -- it teaches the reader to skim the next one. So there are no alarms on
# 4XX (a client sending bad requests is the client's problem), none on invocation counts, and none
# on duration except at the ceiling where duration turns into failure.
#
# The second is that missing data is not a problem. Most of these watch things that are normally
# absent: an empty DLQ publishes nothing to alarm on, and a function nobody has invoked reports no
# errors because there were none. Treating that as breaching would mean an inbox full of alarms
# every quiet week in July, so it is treated as fine nearly everywhere -- and where it is not, the
# comment says why.
#
# ok_actions is set on all of them. A recovery notice costs one more email and is the difference
# between knowing an incident ended and assuming it did.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ------------------------------- Lambda -------------------------------

# Any unhandled exception in any function. Deliberately a threshold of zero rather than a rate:
# at this volume a single error is a real one, and a percentage would need traffic to be
# meaningful -- which is precisely what a newly promoted application does not have yet.

# ------------------------------- SES reputation -------------------------------

# What this domain's own recipients are doing with its mail.
#
# Dimensioned by configuration set, not account-wide, and the distinction is the whole point.
# Three domains send from this AWS account -- osbornesupremacy.com and silverconcord.com are
# declared in the ahzborn-aws landing zone and share default-ses-configuration-set. An undimensioned
# Reputation.BounceRate is the average across all three, so an alarm on it fires here for a bad
# batch sent from somewhere else, and dilutes this application's own bounces in somebody else's
# volume in the other direction. It answers a question about the account while wearing the name of
# the application.
#
# The account-wide version of these two is worth having and lives in ahzborn-aws, next to the
# identities and the quota it actually describes.
#
# email/terraform already enables reputation metrics on giftexchange-outbound, for the reason
# written at ses-delivery-events.tf:20 -- one organizer typing addresses badly is everybody else's
# deliverability, and a rate is the only view that shows that building. These are the alarms that
# comment was anticipating; the metric has been published all along with nothing reading it.
#
# Thresholds sit below the points at which AWS acts (5% bounces, 0.1% complaints) rather than at
# them, since an alarm arriving with the review has told you nothing you can still act on. They are
# per-configuration-set here, so crossing one is not yet an AWS matter at all -- it is the earliest
# point at which this application can see itself heading there.
#
# These are also the alarms most likely to fire for a reason that is nobody's fault: a batch of
# addresses typed from a family group chat will contain typos, and typos bounce. That is exactly
# when it is worth knowing, because the remedy -- correcting the address, which
# api-edit-participant-address.tf exists to make possible -- is available for a few days and then
# is not.
