  # was far enough to leave nothing for the API function: it was denied a slot, API Gateway turned
  # the 429 into its generic 500, and an organizer pressing Copy got an internal server error for
  # a request that never reached the application. This function was throttled on more than half
  # its invocations that day.
  #
  # Two, which is the minimum SQS accepts. Nothing waits on these events -- a delivery status that
  # lands a few seconds later costs nobody anything -- so there is no reason for a background feed
  # to compete with somebody clicking a button. Worth keeping even once the account's concurrency
  # quota is raised: the shape of the failure returns at any scale where a fan-out coincides with
  # somebody using the site, it just takes a bigger exchange to get there.
