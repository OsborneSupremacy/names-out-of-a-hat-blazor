# One page, for the ten minutes after an alarm fires.
#
# This is not a second alarming mechanism and it is not a place to browse. It answers the question
# an alarm email raises and cannot itself answer: an alarm says one metric crossed one line, and
# the next thing anybody wants is whether everything else went with it. A queue backing up while
# errors are flat is a different incident from a queue backing up while the router is throwing.
#
# So the layout is chronological rather than by service -- a request enters at the top and mail
# leaves at the bottom -- and every widget is something an alarm in cloudwatch-alarms.tf can point
# at. Metrics nothing alarms on were left off. A dashboard whose panels nobody has a reason to look
# at is where the panels that matter go to hide.
#
# The first three dashboards in an account are free; this is the account's first.
