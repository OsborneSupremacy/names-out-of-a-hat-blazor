  # At 30 seconds the two disagreed about who gives up first: API Gateway abandoned the request

  # told the write failed after it had succeeded. Timing out first means the invocation is killed,
  # the transaction rolls back, and a failure the caller sees is a failure that happened. One
  # second under the ceiling rather than exactly on it, because API Gateway starts its clock
  # slightly before the invocation does.

# table does not yield anything replayable; being able to enumerate it would undo that. There are
