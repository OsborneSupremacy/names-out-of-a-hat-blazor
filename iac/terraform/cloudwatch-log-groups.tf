# The seven Lambda log groups, and why they are declared at all.
#
# A log group nobody creates still exists. Lambda makes one on the function's first invocation,
# and a group created that way has no retention policy -- which does not mean a default, it means
# never expire. So the choice was never between keeping logs and not keeping them; it was between
# a retention period somebody picked and one nobody did.
#
# That matters more here than it would in most applications, because these logs contain
# participant email addresses (InvitationQueueHandlerService logs the recipient of every send).
# Keeping those forever is a decision, and it was not one anybody had made.
#
# Naming is not a choice: Lambda writes to /aws/lambda/<function name> and cannot be told to write
# anywhere else, so these have to match exactly or the function creates its own alongside them and
# nothing here applies to the logs that actually exist.

  # about what happened in December get asked; short enough that a participant's address is not
  # held for years because of a debugging line. If the PII in these is ever removed at the source,
  # this can go up rather than down -- but retention is the cheaper of the two fixes and it is the
  # one that works on logs already written.
