 *
 * The empty status is the one that matters most to get right. It means nothing has been heard yet
 * — which is the state for the first seconds after a send, and the permanent state for a message
 * whose events were lost — and it is emphatically not "this person did not receive it". An
 * organizer who reads it as the latter goes and pesters somebody who is holding their invitation,

 * What to call each of the things this application sends, when saying which one a status is about.
 *
 * An exchange sends more than one message to the same person and the status shown is the newest of

 * invitation is owed the answer to "delivered what". After an exchange closes that word is often
 * about the announcement, sent weeks after the invitation that went astray.
 *
 * INVITATION and COMPLETION borrow the words EditAddressModal already uses for the same two
 * emails. The two leave notices are named as one thing on purpose: they are the same event told to
 * different people, and the distinction between them is ours rather than the reader's.
 *
 * UNSPECIFIED is deliberately absent. It means a send reached SES without a type tag, which is a
 * mistake in this codebase rather than a fact about the participant, and naming it in the table
 * would ask an organizer to make sense of it.
