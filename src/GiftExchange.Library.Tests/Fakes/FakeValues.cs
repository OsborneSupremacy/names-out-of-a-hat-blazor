    /// duplicate entry in ResetHatTests, a 409 about a duplicate name where AddParticipantTests
    /// expected one about the participant limit, or a 201 that never came. Three classes, failing
    /// differently, roughly one full run in five.

    /// Inside the rule AddParticipantRequestValidator enforces -- letters, digits and spaces are
    /// all it needs -- and short enough that the 100 character bound is never in question. The name
