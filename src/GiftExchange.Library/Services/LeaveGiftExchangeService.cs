/// Leaving: one participant taking themselves out of a gift exchange they did not ask to be in.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Until this existed there was no way out. An organizer can type any address into an exchange, the
/// invitation arrives unannounced, and the only recourse was to write to them and hope. Nothing in
/// this application stopped a send either — a bounce or a complaint was recorded and shown, and the
/// next invitation went out regardless.
///
/// Two endpoints for one action, and the split is the security design rather than an accident of
/// REST, for the same reason the Ask is split. Following a link in an email is a GET, and mail
/// security scanners fetch those on delivery. A GET that removed the participant would fire before
/// the reader had opened anything: somebody pulled out of an exchange they had not yet read they
/// were in, everybody else told to disregard a name, and the organizer sent back to the hat. So the
/// GET renders a form, and the POST behind the button on it does the work.
///
/// Not available to organizers, and the way that is enforced is that no leave token is ever issued
/// for one. A flag would have to be checked, and a check can be forgotten; a lookup that finds
/// nothing cannot be. An organizer who somehow reaches this address gets the same page as a guessed
/// token.
///
/// The order of operations below is deliberate: refusals are written before the participant is
/// removed. The failure mode of the other order is somebody removed from the exchange and freely
/// re-addable, which is precisely the thing they came here to prevent; the failure mode of this one
/// is somebody blocked from an exchange they are still in, which the next attempt fixes.
