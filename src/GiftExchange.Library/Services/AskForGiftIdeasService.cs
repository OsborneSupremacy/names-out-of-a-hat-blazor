/// <summary>
/// The Ask: one participant asking for gift ideas about the person whose name they drew, without
/// being named.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Who they ask is up to them. Asking the person themselves is the obvious route and stays the
/// default, but it is not always the useful one — somebody who does not want to tip off their own
/// mother, however anonymous the email claims to be, can ask her husband and her daughter-in-law
/// instead, and get answers from people who will not spend the next month wondering. So the same
/// button now offers the whole exchange, and any number of them can be asked at once.
///
/// What that costs is a weaker kind of anonymity, and it cannot be engineered away. Being asked
/// what you would like reveals nothing: everybody is drawn by exactly one person, so the recipient
/// already knew somebody held their name. Being asked what somebody else would like reveals that
/// the asker drew that somebody — and the reader knows it was not them and not the subject, so in a
/// small exchange the remaining field is very short. The page says so before anybody chooses, which
/// is the only honest place to put it: the asker is the one person who knows whether the people
/// they have in mind will bother working it out.
///
/// Two endpoints for one action, and the split is the security design rather than an accident of
/// REST. The button lives in an email, so following it is a GET — and mail security scanners,
/// Microsoft Defender Safe Links among them, fetch links in delivered mail to check them. A GET
/// that sent the Ask would therefore fire on delivery for a large share of recipients: their
/// throttle window spent, and somebody mailed on behalf of a person who had not yet read the
/// invitation, let alone clicked anything.
///
/// So the GET only renders the list of people they could ask, which a scanner is welcome to fetch
/// as often as it likes, and the POST behind the button on that page does the work.
