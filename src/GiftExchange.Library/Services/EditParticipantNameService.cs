/// <summary>
/// Changes the name one participant is known by.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Its own endpoint rather than part of <see cref="EditParticipantService"/>, which edits
/// eligibility and resets the hat to IN_PROGRESS as it does — the same reason
/// <see cref="EditParticipantAddressService"/> and <see cref="EditParticipantEmojiService"/> are
/// their own. A rename touches nothing the draw is made of: eligibility and picks are participant
/// ids, and the names in the domain records are read off the person row every time. Resetting a
/// shaken hat over a typo would throw away a draw for no reason at all.
///
/// Every status is valid here for that reason. The one thing an organizer is not told, because it
/// would be noise, is that email already sent still carries the old name — an invitation is a
/// message that has arrived. What is still to be written, the announcement at the end, uses
/// whatever everybody is called by then.
///
/// The reach is the part worth stating plainly, and the interface in front of this should: a name
/// belongs to the person, not to their place in one exchange, so renaming somebody here renames
/// them in every exchange they are in, including ones this organizer does not run. That is not a
/// side effect of the endpoint but of a person being one row — the same thing that lets an
/// organizer correct a name once instead of once per hat.
///
/// Which is exactly why not every organizer may. Having somebody in your exchange is not standing
/// to say what they are called; introducing them is. So the rename is refused for a participant
/// this organizer neither is nor added, and the check itself lives in
/// <c>GiftExchangeProvider.RenamePersonAsync</c> alongside the write, because the same rule has to
/// hold for <see cref="UpdateProfileService"/> and for the add path that would otherwise be a way
/// around both.
