/// Hand-written HTML with inline styles and no scripts, for the reason <see cref="AskPageComposer"/>
/// gives at length: there is no front end to serve these from, and adding one for a handful of short
/// pages would be a poor trade. No script also means a form has to work as a form.
///
/// Extracted here when the leave pages arrived and became the second caller. Two copies of a page
/// shell is exactly the shape that drifts — one gets a viewport tag or a padding change and the
/// other does not — and somebody following a link out of an email is about to be asked to trust the
/// page with an action, so a page that does not look like the product it claims to be is a poor
/// thing to ask that of.
///
/// The one thing these pages ask the network for is the wordmark, which is worth the exception. It
/// is a single image served from the site these pages belong to, nothing depends on it arriving —
/// <see cref="Branding.LogoAltText"/> stands in when it does not — and a scanner fetching the page
/// ahead of the reader may fetch it too, which costs nothing, since the GET has no side effects.
