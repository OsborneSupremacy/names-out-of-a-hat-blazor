/// Randomized and without backtracking, on purpose. A draw has to look arbitrary to the people in
/// it, and a solver that fills the hardest slot first would produce a defensible assignment that
/// is also, year after year, the same assignment. So each attempt walks the participants in a
/// random order taking random eligible picks, and an attempt that strands somebody is thrown away
/// and reseeded rather than unwound. That trade is only affordable because the graphs are dense:
/// a real exchange excludes a handful of pairs out of n squared, so almost every attempt succeeds
/// and the retries are there for the configurations that are merely tight rather than impossible.
/// A genuinely unsatisfiable set of exclusions exhausts the attempts and is reported as a failure,
/// which is the same outcome the caller would want from an exact solver, arrived at without one.
