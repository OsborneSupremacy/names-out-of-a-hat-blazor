/// The resend is automatic, because an address corrected after invitations went out is only ever
/// corrected because somebody did not receive theirs — a correction that left them still not
/// knowing would fix nothing. What is not automatic is the organizer's understanding of it: the
/// response says whether mail went out, so the interface can say so rather than leave them to
