/// one person, a sender has to have been added to an exchange by its organizer, hold a secret token
/// that was mailed to their address, and send from that address. This is not an open relay, and the
/// blast radius of the worst case is a single recipient who already expects to hear from them.
///
/// The rules below close the gaps that would otherwise be left, in the order they are worth having:
/// the true destination of every link is always visible, links that exist to hide a destination are
/// refused, and links back to this application — which nothing legitimate needs and phishing wants
/// — are refused too.
