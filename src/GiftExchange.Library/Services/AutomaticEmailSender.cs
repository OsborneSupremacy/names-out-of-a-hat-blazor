/// <remarks>
/// One place, because it was three, and the duplication had already cost something. Every copy read
/// LIVE_MODE for itself, and the function hosting one of them never had it set, so magic link
/// emails went out marked TEST MODE while invitations went out correctly — no error, no log line,
/// just a flag reading false where nobody had set it.
///
/// Built as raw MIME rather than through SendEmail, which has no way to set a header. The header in
/// question is <c>Auto-Submitted: auto-replied</c>, from RFC 3834, and it is what stops a
/// well-behaved autoresponder at the far end from answering this and being answered in turn. Every
/// message sent here is a response to something, so every one of them needs it.
///
/// Nothing sent here carries a Reply-To. On a forward that is load-bearing rather than tidy: a
/// reply that reached the sender would tell them who holds their name.
