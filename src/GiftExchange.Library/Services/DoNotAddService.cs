/// <remarks>
/// Three lists, asked at once. They are independent questions against independent tables — has this
/// person refused this exchange, this organizer, or all of it — and running them in sequence would
/// spend three round trips on something that answers in the time of one. Each provider method opens
/// its own <c>DbContext</c> from the factory, which is what makes that safe; a shared context is not
/// thread-safe and is the reason the factory exists at all.
///
/// The three are never distinguished to the caller. A single refusal message covers all of them on
/// purpose: an organizer who could tell "they blocked you" from "they blocked everybody" could
/// learn, by typing an address into a new exchange, a fact the person deliberately did not tell
/// them. What the organizer needs to know is that this address is not available to them, and that
/// is the whole of what they are told.
///
/// Fails open, unlike <c>ReplyThrottleProvider</c>, which fails closed. The comparison is worth
/// stating because the two look alike and the trade runs the other way. A throttle that fails open
/// sends mail somebody has already had; this check failing closed would refuse every add for as
/// long as the database was unreachable, which breaks the ordinary use of the application to
/// enforce a rule against a person who is probably not in the request at all. Exceptions therefore
/// propagate rather than being swallowed into a refusal — the caller's own error handling turns
/// them into a 500, which is honest, rather than into "this person has asked not to be added",
/// which would not be.
