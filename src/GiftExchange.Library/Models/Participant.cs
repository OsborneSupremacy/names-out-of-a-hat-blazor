    /// <remarks>
    /// Stored rather than derived, so an organizer can change it and so it says the same thing in
    /// the list, in the invitation and in the announcement. It is decoration and nothing else:
    /// nothing is identified by it, and two people in one hat may end up sharing one.

    /// How far the last email this exchange sent them is known to have got — one of

    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Empty is the state before anything is sent and for a while after it: SES publishes events
    /// asynchronously, so a participant sits here for seconds even when everything works. It means
    /// "nothing heard", and never "not delivered". Anything showing this to an organizer has to say
    /// so, because the two readings lead to opposite actions — one is a reason to check an address,
    /// the other a reason to wait.

    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Written by a stranger's mail server rather than by this application or by an organizer, so
    /// it is the one field on this record that has passed through no moderation at all. Whatever
    /// renders it encodes it.

    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// An exchange sends more than one thing to the same person, and the status here is the newest
    /// row rather than the invitation's. Without this an organizer reading "delivered" next to
    /// somebody who says they never saw the invitation has no way to tell whether that word is
    /// about the invitation at all — it may be the announcement that the exchange had finished,
    /// sent weeks later to an address that swallowed the first message.

    /// this API spells a timestamp it does not have.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This is the fact an organizer can hand to a participant who cannot find their invitation.
    /// "Delivered" alone gives them nothing to search for; a date and a time tells them which
    /// morning to look in, which is the difference between finding it in a junk folder and
    /// concluding it was never sent.
