/// for text. These are the same idea carried one step further: a real row at the all-zero id, so
/// that a column pointing at "nobody" points at something that exists. A join to it is an inner
/// join, and the result is an empty name rather than a missing row to account for.
///
/// They are seeded twice over, and deliberately: by Liquibase into the real database
/// (the --0002 seed files in db/tables), and by <c>HasData</c> into the model, which is
/// what puts them in the databases the test suite builds with EnsureCreated. NoRecordTests holds
/// the two spellings to each other.
///
/// Methods rather than properties, because entities are mutable: a shared instance would be one
/// stray assignment away from a sentinel that is no longer empty.
