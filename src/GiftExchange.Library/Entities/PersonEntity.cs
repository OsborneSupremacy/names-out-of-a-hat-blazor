    /// organizer who shares a participant with another organizer would otherwise be able to rename
    /// them out from under both. Two people may make the edit: this person, who holds the address
    /// the row is identified by, and whoever first typed their name into an exchange. Everybody
    /// else is refused.
    ///
    /// Self-referencing rather than sentinel-valued for somebody who arrived under their own steam,
    /// which is the case for every organizer creating their first exchange. That reads correctly
    /// through the rule instead of needing an exception to it: a person may always change their own
    /// name, and "nobody introduced them" is spelled as "they introduced themselves".

    /// name — the person is found, and the name they already have stands.
